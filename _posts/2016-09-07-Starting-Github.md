    <td>I worked together with Matt if I got stuck so we could both try to work it out and progress quicker. I also followed along when the instructions were being given. This helped because it meant that I didn't have to worry about forgetting what I was supposed to do and I finished much quicker.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>When I had finished the first set of instructions, I stopped to help people who were stuck. I think that it is good to help people but I would have finished quicker if I had asked for the next instruction and kept going. I need to work on my active listening because I don’t want to forget instructions and I could do the task properly, without doing anything wrong.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will try to make sure that I have finished everything before I help people. I will try to take notes as the instructions are being given if i’m not following along with them. This will mean that I will have clearly written out the steps and I will complete the task.</td>
