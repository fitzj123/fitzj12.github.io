    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To make a file that contains all of the games and you can choose which one you want to play.</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I found that the most effective strategy was to use functions to separate out all of my games. This made it a lot easier when I was writing my code that asks what game the user would like to play. This is because I had to use an 'if' statement and it meant that I could just call a function after each condition rather than writing out the entire code for the game chosen.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that I need to work on my logical thinking and attention to detail. This is because, normally, most of the mistakes I make are syntax errors which are easy to fix as the computer tells me what the error is and where it is. Even if I don’t know what the error means, I can look it up or ask someone around me. However, in this lesson I found that the mistakes I was making weren’t syntax related and were things in my code that meant that the game didn’t work properly. For example, in my higher or lower game I had a set number of turns but the game didn’t end when you were out of turns.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will not only be careful about syntax errors but also pay attention when I am testing my game and try to end up with all of the possible outcomes to make sure that everything works. I need to try to win my game, lose my game or do anything possible rather than just paly it once and assume that it’s fine.</td>
