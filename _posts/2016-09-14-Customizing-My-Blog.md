    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I have a  plain blog with one post.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To add colour to my blog and edit the layout of my post.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, the body and header of my blog have colour and my post has bold titles and the text underneath them.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>I worked with Theo, who was next to me, to organize my post. At the start, the text was all over the place and had no clear format. He helped me to clear out the unnecessary code so it was easier to format. I also helped other people to format theirs.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on my independence. This is because I had to rely on Theo and Alex to show me how to format my post. Once I found out how to do it, I was fine to do it on my own but I had to wait for them to show me at the start. I also helped people while I was still in the middle of my work.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will try to figure out how to do things myself instead of relying on the person next to me to show me how to do it. I will also make sure I have finished my own work before I stop to help anyone else.</td>
