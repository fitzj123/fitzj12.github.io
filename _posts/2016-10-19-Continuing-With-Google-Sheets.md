    <td>A spreadsheet with one sheet for orders.</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To have multiple sheets on my spreadsheet.</td>

(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td> Yes, I now have a sheet for orders, stock, costs, employees and profit and loss.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I made sure to listen to the teacher so that I knew what sheets I had to make. I used google to find out anything that I didn't know, this greatly assisted me as I was able to look up how to make my vlookup formula work as I broke it while attempting to move my order list to a different sheet. Thankfully, I was successful in this endeavour. I also helped people around me and asked for help if I needed it.   </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on my decision making because I spent a lot of time trying to decide what numbers I wanted and where I wanted to put everything. I would have been a great deal more efficient had I not wasted time on small things and focused on the important details. Although it means I have a substantially large amount of stock, reciting pi from memory into my quantities was probably a waste of time (even though I can do it very quickly).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try to work more quickly and I will wait before I help people. I went to help others before I had made all of my sheets and it would have helped to finish the main parts of my spreadsheet first. This week I worked a lot more independently than last week so I will continue that next time.</td>
