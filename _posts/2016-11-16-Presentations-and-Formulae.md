    <td>To watch and assess some presentations and to revise the vlookup formula for homework.</td>

(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td> Yes, we watched some presentations and I made a new sheet to revise vlookup formulae.</td>

    <td>When we were watching the presentations I had to the focused and listen. I found listening feedback that others received very helpful as I could reflect on how I could have changed mine to improve it even though I didn't get to present mine. When doing the homework, I had to persevere. At first, my vlookup formula wasn’t working and kept coming up with errors saying that it couldn’t find values in the named range and that it was searching in an out of bounds area. I had to spend a while trying to fix these problems, although the out of bounds one was just because I spelt the named range incorrectly.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on my thinking flexibly because that way, I would have been able to generate alternatives in a more efficient manner. However, I still managed to get my formula working, so maybe it was worth spending quite a while trying to fix it instead of instantly getting it right. I think that I will remember how do it now because I had to do it so many times.</td>

    <td>Next time, I will make sure that I don’t get frustrated when things don’t work so that I can logically think of a solution. This will help me to get everything working, even if it doesn’t work at first.</td>
