    <td>To have a code that asks for a table number and takes an order.</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learned by persevering. Often my code didn't work but it was almost always a syntax error that I could easily fixed. I had to organise my code into functions as I started without using them and found it too confusing.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited as I spent a long time on one problem. I had a long if function and I wrote if for all of them instead of elif. Therefore, unless it was the last option it would give the answer for my else statement.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will make sure to utilize computational thinking in order to work out problems quickly and not waste time. I couldâ€™ve been much more efficient had I thought logically.</td>
  </tr>
