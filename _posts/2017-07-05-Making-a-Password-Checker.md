    <td>I found that I had to ask for help as I began by making different functions that contained different usernames and passwords but I then realised that the exercise meant that I was supposed to use a list or dictionary. I wasn't sure of how dictionaries worked in python so I asked for help from another student who kindly explained them to me so I understood how to make it work and why I had to write if username = password.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited as I could only think of one possible solution to the problem which didnâ€™t work very well/ Had I used logical thinking, I would have soon realised that I needed to link the username to the password together in a dictionary as otherwise, any username would work with any password in the code.</td>

    <td>Next time, I will try to seek necessary help quicker as I think that I wasted a lot of time doing the wrong thing. The help that I get could be looking it up and finding a website or asking a fellow student or the teacher, but either way it is quicker than wasting time doing the wrong thing and taking the wrong approach to a problem.</td>
