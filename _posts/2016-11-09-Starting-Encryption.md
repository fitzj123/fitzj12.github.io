    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To start learning about encryption with my dynamic learning and to make a presentation about similarities of ciphers for homework.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td> Yes, I have read about ciphers and made my presentation.</td>

    <td>I learned by making sure that I properly read what was on my screen. When we were reading about encryption, I made sure that I actually read it instead of just skimming through it. This helped me as otherwise my understanding of the subject would be extremely vague. For the homework, I decided to categorise different groups of similar techniques used in ciphers (as well as googling if it is supposed to be cipher or cypher. Turns out they are both correct but i'll stick with cipher.) I found that categorising groups helped me as I could find examples in the groups instead of just talking about every single cipher that I found.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This isn’t part of the encryption work, but I definitely need to work on my organisation as I didn’t submit a link to my blog on google classroom. This happened as I had submitted it to an earlier assignment so I must have forgotten to submit it to the new one. I also need to improve my logical thinking as while doing my homework, I found some ciphers that I didn’t understand and therefore couldn’t explain them in my presentation. If I think more logically, hopefully I will be able to figure out and understand more things in the future.</td>

    <td>Next time I will always make sure to check google classroom so that I don’t forget any assignments! I will also make sure to stay focused so that I work efficiently and I will make sure that I actually understand everything so that I actually know what I am talking about.</td>
