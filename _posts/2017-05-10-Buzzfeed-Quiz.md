  <tr>
    <td>I had to be creative to come up with my idea instead of copying others around me. However, this didn't work out as the people sitting next to me just copied me. I also thought logically as to which approach would be most feasible.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I should work quicker and not dwell on the same thing for too long. I spent too much time trying to come up with an idea and which questions to use. I should’ve just gotten on with the questions instead of doing lots of research about the topic and then not having enough time.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will work more efficiently so that I can begin working on the actual code instead of spending too long on something like the questions which aren’t really that important.</td>
