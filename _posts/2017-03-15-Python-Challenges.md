    <td>I learnt by trying lots of different techniques in order to finish each challenge. A lot of the time, I found that the first thing I tried didn't work so I had to persevere. I also found it helpful to google information like the date and time module to help me.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think I need to work on my logical thinking as I spent a long time on challenges 5 and 6 as I couldn't figure out how to use the date and time. I could have easily completed challenge 6 in a much more efficient manner had I just done it as simply as possible to make sure that it worked.</td>

    <td>Next time I will try to work to work more independently and more efficiently. Therefore, I won't have to distract others by constantly asking them for help and I will get my own work done quicker.</td>
