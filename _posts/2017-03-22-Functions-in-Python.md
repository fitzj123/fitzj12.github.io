    <td>When Alex was teaching us, I made sure to ask questions when I didn't understand it as then he could explain it to me in a way that I would understand. At first, I didn’t get why if you told it to return a string it printed none instead of the string, but I found out that you would have to print the function to print the string.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think I should just work on my listening as I missed the information about returns and thought that if it said return it would print whatever it was returning. I should also make sure to not forget how to use other things work as I forgot about functions.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try to use computational thinking to work out something I don’t understand as it would’ve made more sense if I thought about it logically. That way, I will understand things quicker and won’t distract others by asking for help.</td>
