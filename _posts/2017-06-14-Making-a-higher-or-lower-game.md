    <td>I found that the most efficient strategy was to search up anything that I was unsure about  so that I didn't distract anyone else. This meant that I was able to find a good way to generate a random number for each higher or lower guess. I also found that it was best to write my code through just through my own knowledge then going and fixing syntax issues after as this was quicker than writing it more carefully and slowly. It was helpful to test my game and make sure that everything works. This meant that I went through and made changes such as making it say if you win and lose instead of it just ending.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that I need to improve my logical thinking as I forgot that I need to make a while loop end at some point as I made a loop that never ended and just generated a random number so it went on forever and crashed the website so I had to start again.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will improve my learning by making sure that I don’t do anything that will break my code and also try to make my coding more accurate so I won’t have to spend as much time fixing simple syntax errors and spelling mistakes.</td>
