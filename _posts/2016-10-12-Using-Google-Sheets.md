    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To have a working spreadsheet that shows the total price of an order.</td>

(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td> Yes, my spreadsheet adds up the subtotal, delivery price and VAT of an order to make a grand total.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I made sure to pay attention to what the teacher said so that I could make my formula accurate. When we told how to do the second formula I took notes which helped me because it stopped me from forgetting what I had to do.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on my accuracy because I often managed to break my formula because I tried to click on another cell instead of pressing return. This meant that it would have a random cell that I had selected in my formula.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will take notes right from the start so I don't forget any formulae. I will also be more careful to not make any mistakes so my spreadsheet will work smoothly.</td>
