    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>A blog with a blue and pink colour scheme and posts with tables.</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To improve my colour scheme and add a gradient.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td> Yes, I made the header and footer of my page the same colour and the background is a gradient from light blue to dark blue.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I used lots of experimentation. I looked up how to make a gradient and had to use lots of different colours and combinations to find something that looks good. I used the w3schools website to find out how to make a gradient.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on my planning because I was very indecisive. It took me a long time to decide what colour I wanted my gradient to be and what shade of blue I wanted. It also took me a long time to decide how many pixels of padding I wanted to put on my table because I wanted to make it easy to read.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will plan ahead so I know what I want my blog to look like before I start changing it. This way, I won't take a long time to make decisions and my blog will look better as I wonâ€™t just be making it up as I go along.</td>
