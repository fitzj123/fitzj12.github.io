    <td>I made sure to focus on my own work and not get distracted by others. I found that it was effective to  write my code into the doc and copy and paste it into repl.it to check that it worked. This meant that I could try to do it all at once and then check to see if I had done anything wrong.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think I need to persevere more. This is because when I encountered an issue, I was very quick to ask for help. This got better at the end though, as the main issue was just the font from when I copied and pasted the code from the doc into repl.it. Therefore I was easily able to fix the syntax errors by re-typing the speech marks.</td>
