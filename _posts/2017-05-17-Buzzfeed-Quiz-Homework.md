    <td>In the lesson, I started with just my questions written up. I wrote code for all of the questions to add 1 point to either Apple or Android based on the answer to this question. I finished the lesson with a total of 11 questions. I split my time at home into two halves. I spent the first half making my scoring system more elaborate by giving the side that the answer is for more points based on how important their answer is in terms of using the phone. I spent the second half of my time adding more questions so that the quiz now has 15.</td>

    <td>What I did to improve my quiz:</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I improved the scoring system. Before, it said if answer is a or b, add one point to apple, if answer is c or d add one point to android. I made it so that the answers (a,b,c or d) were random so that a and b weren't always Apple. I also made it so that, instead of every answer being worth 1 point, I made more crucial answers worth 2 or 3. I also added more questions which also have the points-based scoring.</td>
