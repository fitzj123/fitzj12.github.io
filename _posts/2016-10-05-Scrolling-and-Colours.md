    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>A blog without a fixed background and a pink and blue colour scheme.</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To make my background and header stay still when I scroll.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td> Yes, my background and header are fixed and I have a new background and colour scheme.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I had to use a lot of trial and error to find a colour scheme that worked with my new background. I also used w3schools to find out how to use z-index and how to fix my header and background.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on my flexible thinking so that I will be able to find solutions to problems that I face. An example is making my writing go underneath my header. I should have used flexible thinking to efficiently find a solution.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will make better use of w3schools to find out how to do things so that I can easily find out solutions myself.</td>
