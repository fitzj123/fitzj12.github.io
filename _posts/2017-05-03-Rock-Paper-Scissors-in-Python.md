    <td>I tried to learn more independently. When I needed to make the code generate a random number between 1 and 3, instead of asking someone who knows I endeavoured to retrieve said crucial information by myself by looking it up and applying it to the situation. I eventually did need to ask for help but ended up coming up with the solution myself.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I was limited by not thinking more logically when I tried to make a loop. I tried to make on that would make it go again if it was a draw but it ended up printing "It' a draw" until it crashed. I then asked for help instead of thinking of a different solution straight away.</td>

    <td>Next time I will tackle all issues with a more logical mindset in order to complete the task efficiently. This will mean that I wonâ€™t need to bother others by asking for help.</td>
