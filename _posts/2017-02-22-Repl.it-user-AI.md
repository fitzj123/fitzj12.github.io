    <td>I made sure to remember the syntax required to complete an if, so that I wouldn't do it all wrong and then be obligated to go back and fix it all after. If I had a syntax error it was generally because I had clicked run without finishing the line of code I was on.</td>

    <td>Translating my questions into Spanish, French and Icelandic may have been a waste of time, although it is nice to have a multilingual AI. Other than this, I worked quite efficiently as I added an extra question. I couldâ€™ve worked better if I had stuck to the instructions and made my questions multiple choice as I spent a long time making replies to possible answers. </td>
