    <td>I found that the most effective way to work was to work with the parameters and look up what I didn't know. I managed to put throught the variable that contained the variable for the radius which the user had chosen through all of the different steps in my program that  worked out the circumference and area of a circle. I asked for the radius in one function, worked out the circumference in another, worked out the area in another and finally displayed the results. I only had to seek help when it came to calling the functions as I didn’t know how to call functions inside of calling another function.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think that my learning was limited by the speed at which I worked as I probably could have added some more different unit conversions in the lesson instead of doing it as homework. I also did have to ask for some help when I could have been more independent, for example when I had to call my functions. However, asking for help did mean that I was able to do it when I was making my next program which calculated the volume of a cuboid in a similar way.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time, to improve my learning, I will make sure to avoid distractions and work as efficiently as I possibly can. This way, I will be able to get more done in the lesson and move through tasks a lot quicker. On top of this, I will try to not let other people help me as much and try to figure everything out for myself. If I still can’t solver a problem and need someone to help me, at the very least I should make sure that I understand why the solution is what it is and how it works.</td>
