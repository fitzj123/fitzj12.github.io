  <tr>
    <td>I learned by looking up things that I didn't know how to do. This allowed me to remember how to do tables and then make striped tables with another colour as well as the background. I found trial and error effective as when something didn’t work I just had to keep trying until it did.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited as I spent too long trying to solve a problem when the best solution was just to press on edit history and go back to the last point that the blog actually worked and work from there. My learning was also limited by the fact that my website wouldn’t refresh even when github said that it had been published.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try not to waste as much time logging and starting up as I wasted time when deleting the repository and making a new one as I accidentally deleted the posts folder so I had to start again. I will also not spend too long on a problem that I can’t solve if I can just go back to before I messed up the code.</td>
