    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>A blog with no tables and a basic colour scheme.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To have my blog posts in tables and to make a nice colour scheme.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td> Yes, my blog has a pink and blue colour scheme with a picture of the ocean as a background.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I used a lot of trial and error. I had to try lots of different colour codes to find something that looks good. It also took me a lot of tries to make my tables work and look good. I persevered with the trial and error so that in the end I made my page look good.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I had to ask people for help a lot. I wasn't sure how to make the table the right size so I had to keep asking the people next to me. I need to improve my logical thinking because I found it hard to find a colour scheme that looks good and makes it easy to read.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will make sure that I persevere if something goes wrong or if I break my website. I will also try to find out how to do more things for myself so I can work more efficiently and so I can improve my logical thinking.</td>
